/*
    Time Class
    Time class with three member variables and three member functions
    Member functions are defined in Time.cpp

    Destructors
        - The name of the destructor is the class name preceded by a tilde (~)
        - Destructors have no return type
        - Destructors take no arguments
        - Destructors are called automatically when an object is destroyed
        - Destructors are called in the reverse order of constructors
        - Destructors are called when an object goes out of scope
        - Destructors are called when delete is used to deallocate memory for a dynamically allocated object
        - Destructors are called when a temporary object goes out of scope
        - Destructors are called when an exception is thrown
        - Destructors are called when a program ends
        - Destructors are called when a block ends
        - Destructors are called when a function ends


    Constructors and destructor are call integrety

/*
    Default Memberwise Assignment
    
    The assignment operator (=) can be used to assign an object to another object of the same class
    The default memberwise assignment operator copies the member variables of the right-hand object to the left-hand object

    Object may be passed as function arguments and may be returned from functions
    When an object is passed as an argument, the object is passed by value
    When an object is returned from a function, the object is returned by value
